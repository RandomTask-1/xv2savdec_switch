## Credits
- **Eternity** - Huge thanks goes to Eternity for his/her initial work on a save file decryptor/encryptor - [xv2savdec](http://animegamemods.net/thread/701/tools-eternity) for PS4/XBone/PC
- **Falo** - For converting the [xv2savdec](https://gbatemp.net/threads/is-xenoverse-2-save-encryption-being-worked-on-by-anyone.512671/#post-8209053) for the Switch, he/she converted the decryption function while I converted the encryption function

Falo was also the one who found out that the Switch version does not contain an MD5 header.
